        <h3>Web Developer in Training!<h3>
        <p>
            I am currently studying full stack web development at CodeCraft in Boulder, Colorado. I have been hooked on coding ever since taking an introductory programming course in college. I love the challenges posed by difficult problems and the excitement that comes with solving them. I have learned quite a bit on my own, but am very excited to finally be a part of a professional boot camp here at CodeCraft.</p>
        <p>
            Aside from writing code, I also enjoy reading, gaming, Japanese language and culture, and anything outdoors. My goal is to take the skillset learned here at CodeCraft and aquire a position as a junior web developer. I aspire to constantly improve as a developer and build upon my knowledge, each day.</p>
